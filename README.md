I use tsc typescript and yarn for this project

setup with 
yarn install
yarn add @helia/unixfs

to make ts into js just use
tsc

index html is the main page
only one entry point
node server.js

Main page will redirect to issuer and user

verify files with test_files directory

each launch will have its own ipfs instance (dont know if it just store in memory or it does store somewhere in disk)
